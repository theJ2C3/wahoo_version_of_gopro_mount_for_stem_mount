# wahoo_version_of_gopro_mount_for_stem_mount
this is design for some wahoo user trying out some cheap stem mount just like in picture

it is suggested to print with the gopro part with those flat horizontally and wahoo mount with some degree tilt to improve the strengh of the output.
the wahoo part is download from thingiverse and big thanks to creator
i only put here for easy download
if you use this, feel free to give kudos to original drawer

you may need 4 m.4 flat headed screw
